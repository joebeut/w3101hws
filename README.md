Hello, my name is Joe Beutler. I am a senior majoring in CS and Hispanic Studies. I am from the town of St. George in Southern Utah. I came to Columbia to swim for the Men's Swimming and Diving team. I interned for Goldman Sachs Technology and will continue working for my team there when I graduate--unless one of my side projects takes off! ;)

I am looking forward to learning some full-stack programming for web dev in JS. I have built web based apps using HTML/CSS with Foundations CSS framework and PHP and MySQL on the backend
, but I'd like to take my responsive web skills to the next level and make apps better suited for mobile.

I look forward to working with you guys!

Joe
